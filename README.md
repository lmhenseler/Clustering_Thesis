Identification of topics and communities in the Manosphere with the usage of clustering

The aim of this study is to identify and categorize topics and communities of interest
within the manosphere, particularly focusing on the Seduction Gurus community.
The manosphere is an online community composed of users who share a critical stance
towards feminism and women. Within this community, the Seduction Gurus are a relatively
understudied group that promotes emotional and psychological manipulation techniques
to seduce women.
To analyze the topics discussed by this collective on the social network Twitter, clustering techniques, specifically using BERTopic, are applied to a dataset of over a million
tweets from users of this group. Through the clustering process, 1,058 topics are identified,
which are grouped into broader themes for detailed analysis.
The main identified themes include social and political issues, personal relationships,
finance and cryptocurrencies, sports, religion, culture and entertainment, COVID-19 and
vaccines, sex, gym and wellness. These topics reflect the prevailing concerns, interests, and
social dynamics within the manosphere.
Furthermore, with the goal of detecting communities based on the discussed themes,
user clustering with HDBScan is conducted, resulting in 7 clusters. The communities are
analyzed based on the predominant topics, revealing that the groups were centered on
South Asian politics, football, global political and social issues, Kenyan politics, finance
and digital economy, reflections on life and personal development, and Nigerian politics.
